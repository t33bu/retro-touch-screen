Design documentation for C64 and VIC-20 touch screen controller

In this project, [Nextion HMI](https://nextion.itead.cc/) 2.4-inch touch display is used as a controller for Commodore 64 and VIC-20 computers. The touch screen emulates paddle controllers similarly as the well-known KoalaPad. 

The technical details of the project will be first published in the Finnish computer culture magazine [Skrolli](https://www.skrolli.fi/en/) in forthcoming issue 2018.4, and later in this repository.
